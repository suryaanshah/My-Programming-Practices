Hope these solutions will help you and me become a better coder. Happy Coding!


If you are new to python cocding, then let me tell you some basic language glossary. Any line with a # before it is treated as a comment. Comments are a great way of communicating with the viewers of the code and help them understand the code better. Also suppose if you look at your own projest after a long time, then you yourself will be able to understand the code and make improvements to it or add more methods of solving the same problem.
